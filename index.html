    <h2>Bro Split</h2>
    <p>
        This Split is suited for people who want to live in the gym but still have weekends, and
        consists of training each body part once a day. Monday may be reserved for only chest training,
        followed on Tuesday by back, and so on so forth. The pros of this training style are it ensures
        that the muscle group in question is thuroughly activated, however the cons are that you will have
        large gaps between working each muscle group that may not be ideal for hypertrophy.

    <h2>Push Pull Legs (PPL)</h2>
    <p>
        This Split is suited for people who have more time to go to the gym each week and
        want to maximize the frequency at which they hit each muscle group. The order of the push, pull
        , and leg split is not set in stone, meaning it can take the form of legs, pull, push if desired.
        The pros of this training style are its frequency, and guranteed muscle recovery of 48 hours, however
        the cons are you will have to frequent the gym more often and lose your weekends.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Monday</th>
            <th>Tuesday</th>
            <th>Wednesday</th>
            <th>Thursday</th>
            <th>Friday</th>
            <th>Saturday</th>

    <h2>Upper Lower</h2>
    <p>
        This Split is suited for people who are willing to put more work into their gym sessions
        while also putting more emphais on legs, and frequency. This split allows for one day to be used for the
        desired upper body exercises, typically one or two compound movements with two to three
        accessories. Followed by a day for the desired low body exercises using the same methodoly
        mentioned before for the exercise selection. The pros of this training style is the increased
        in frequency for lower body movements which may interest people trying to fill out their legs,
        coupled with having weekends. The cons are the gym sessions themselves
        must be longer to account for the needed weekly volume.
